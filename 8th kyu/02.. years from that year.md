// SOLUTION //
```javascript
//  each century has 99 years, 1900 is 19th cen and one day more is 20th century,
// if we divide by 100 we can remove 2 digits from the end. 

// The we will round it as we only need 2 digits, 2 methods are .ceil and .floor.
// We cannot use floor, cause for example 1901 is gonna be 19.01, which is 20th cen
// if we round down it will be 19th thus its better to round up.

function century(year) {
    // Calculate the century by dividing the year by 100 and rounding up
    return Math.ceil(year / 100);
}
```
